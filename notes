Stuff to do

1 - Add more recipies to the database. Watch for bugs

2 - Search function
    Xremove the default search when the page first loads

    -Make the search work with the enter key by splitting the app into 2 forms.
    -wtf is up with the size of the results? "chili" must be a block element. make the results work better
    -No functionality to search by tag yet

3 - Calander
    XMake the number of servings sticky in the select box.
    -Later... find a way to handle the user changing the calander information when portions are already filled out.
        -Add a button the clear the recipe
            ?How does this effect other days?
    -Create the servings-leftovers functionality

            Xsubtract the number of people from the number of servings
            Xdisplay the difference
            -make the difference draggable, repeat process
                -leftovers need to input text into the textboxes instead of numbers
                -Remove the old leftovers and only keep the new
                -leftovers need to be labeled
            ?What happens if theres a half portion being used as a full portion? error
            ?What if there are not enough servings in the recipe to feed everybody?
