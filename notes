Stuff to do

1 - Add more recipies to the database. Watch for bugs

2 - Search function
    -remove the default search when the page first loads
    -for now, remove the catagory requirment for the search. Just use search type and the search box.
    -Make the search work with the enter key by splitting the app into 2 forms.

3 - Calander
    -Make the number of servings sticky in the select box.
    -Later... find a way to handle the user changing the calander information when portions are already filled out.
    -Create the servings-leftovers functionality
    -Why doesn't drag and drop work?
